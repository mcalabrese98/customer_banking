# customer_banking

I used class presented material (../3/Activities) to help me with my homework. We reviewed the accounts with our instructor Metin. 

* "customer_banking.py" is the main python file which interacts w/ the user (managing the users savings & CD accounts
* "savings_account.py" contains the "create_savings_account" function
* "cd_account" is the python file that contains the "create_cd_account" function"
* "Accounts.py" contains the class for balance and interest equations used on both the savings & CD accounts/

These files are all located in the main branch of my "customer_banking" repository.
